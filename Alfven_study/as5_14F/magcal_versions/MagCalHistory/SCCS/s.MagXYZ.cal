# The gain and offset matrix from R. Strangeway document 5/96.
# Currently gain*(raw-offset). Linear, order2, order3 not used.
# delta_t for very fine adjustments.

# delay is know.
# Phase K constrained to between 0 and 2*pi, and difference calculated with
# V1-V2 as the baseline.
# Gain is calculated as:  (1000)(0.5)/(gain bits) mV.
# "Gain" and "Offset" entries taken from 100kHz data at 500 kHz Nyquist.
# In the table below, the Nyquist frequency is 125 kHz for the first group, 
# of data, 500 kHz for the second group and 1 MHz for the third group.
